      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Brawl Stars is a free game on the App Store for iPhone and Google Play for Android users. Brawl Stars is a shoot-'em-up game developed by Supercell. In this game, you unlock certain brawlers that you get or collect by opening Brawl Boxes or from the "Trophy Road." In the game, there are a variety of modes which are as follows:</p>
      <div class="line"></div>
      
      <h2>Gem Grab</h2>
      <img src="https://brawlstarsup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gem-grab-brawlers.jpg">
      <p>In this mode, you and a team of two other people verse another team with the same amount of people. The goal of Gem Grab is to collect ten gems from the Gem Mine in the center of the map, which periodically spawns more gems. When a team collects at least 10 gems, a 15 second countdown starts. As long as you are able to hold on to those gems without dying, you win.</p>
      <div class="line"></div>
      
      <h2>Showdown</h2>
      <img src="https://brawlstarsup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/duo-showdown.png">
      <p>The next game mode is Showdown. Here, you are put up against 9 other people. Your goal is to eliminate all others and be the last one standing. To make things interesting, there are Power Boxes which drop green Power Ups. Once you pick it up, you do more damage and have more health. There is also Duo Showdown in which you fight with a teammate against 4 other teams.</p>
      <div class="line"></div>
      
      <h2>Heist</h2>
      <img src="https://brawlstarsup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heist-game-mode.png">
      <p>Another game mode is Heist. In this game mode, you and your opponents have a safe. Your goal is to destroy the enemies safe while defending your own. If you destroy the enemies safe, you win the game, but if they destroy yours, you lose.</p>
      <div class="line"></div>
      
      <h2>Bounty</h2>
      <img src="https://brawlstarsup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bounty-mode.png">
      <p>Bounty is a game mode where you have to collect stars by killing people. After each kill, your bounty goes up (hence the name of the game). If you or any of your teammates die, the other team gets the bounty (which are stars). At the end of the match, whoever has the most stars wins.</p>
      <div class="line"></div>
      
      <h2>Brawl Ball</h2>
      <img src="https://brawlstarsup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/brawlball.jpg">
      <p>In another game mode, Brawl Ball, a soccer ball is placed in the middle of the map. Your goal (no pun intended) is to shoot the ball into the opposing team's goal. Whichever team scores 2 goals first wins. After a set period of time, if both teams are tied, the game goes into Overtime. The first team to score in Overtime wins.</p>
      <div class="line"></div>
      
      <h2>Siege</h2>
      <img src="https://brawlstarsup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/siege-brawl-stars.png">
      <p>Siege is the final game mode. In this game mode, you and your enemies have an "IKE" turret. Your goal is to pick up the bolts that spawn in the middle of the map. After a set period of time, whichever team has more bolts will get a robot. This robot will target the enemies and their "IKE." Be warned, though, as if the opposing team got the robot, it will target you, your teammates, and your "IKE!" At the end of the game, whichever team's "IKE" has the most health wins.</p>
      <div class="line"></div>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Brawl Stars is a fun and free to play game that can be either relaxing or competitive (depending on how you play it). When I started playing the game, it was a lot of fun (and rather addicting). It's honestly the only game I've ever really enjoyed playing.</p>
